#### Exercise #2: URL Shortener

##### Exercise details

The goal of this exercise is to create an [http.Handler](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler) that will look at the path of any incoming web request and determine if it should redirect the user to a new page, much like URL shortener would.
